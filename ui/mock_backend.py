"""Mock backend so the UI works before the real FastAPI + Qdrant backend exists.

Mirrors the API contract in implementation.md:
  POST   /search    -> {query, mode, fusion, filter, hits[], timings_ms, answer?}
  POST   /passages  -> {status, pid}
  DELETE /passages/{pid}
  GET    /stats     -> {points, status}

Everything here is FAKE demo data. Never put these numbers in the report.
